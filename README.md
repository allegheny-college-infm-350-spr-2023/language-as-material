# Prompt 3: Language as Material

## Summary

Our exploration of language as a form of data continues to break down the meanings, uses, and understandings we have about what constitutes language tech. In this prompt, we consider what language looks like if it is further reduced and permuted, given strict templates which make language boring, or taken up as a purely visual medium. The approaches reduce language to _just what it is_, a system of signs and symbols that _can_ mean, but doesn't always. This is true, at least, as far as we hold to agreements like syntax, subject/verb relationships, and other normative views of linguistics as a sense toward meaning rather than a set of meanings working toward sense.

(Think that's confusing? One of the readings mentions [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)). Look it up; it's wild.)

Though some of us have already explored the permissionless "meaningspace" of raw data, this week, we _all do_.

## Goals

* Explore pure code as an expressive medium
* Gain an introduction to Javascript, particularly a visual library called `p5.js`
* Highlight differences and similarities between Javascript and Python
* Engage with developing "writing machines"

## Outcomes

* 2 poems which engage the idea of language as a material object:
  * 1 **must** engage with only a single letter as a visual form (using the `p5.js` editor)
  * 1 **_may_** use only text to engage some embodied experience: voice, touch, color -- the list is open-ended
    * `p5.js`, for example, has the ability to take in microphone input
  * 1 **_may_** engage with the more combinatoric, permutational texture that Piringer and Montfort use
    * for this, using Python is OK (probably your best bet?)

To assist you in creating your work, we will dedicate a significant amount of time during lab exploring some of hte basic ways we use `p5.js`. Keep in mind that you may always use `RiTa` (link in Discord channel) to supplement your work if you choose to do a text-based, permutative, "drone" poem like "part of" or "interests".

## Process

* Code for these works should be placed in the `src` directory.
* Outcomes which aren't on the `p5.js` platform should be added to the `writing` directory
* For outcomes produced using `p5.js`, either:
  * right-click and `Save As...` on the picture canvas, or
  * screencapture the work (this is especially useful if the canvas uses the `reset()` function on click)

For `p5.js`-based works, I invite you to link to the sketch in the table below. To get your link:

* click `File`
* locate and click `Share`
* choose the `Full Screen` option
